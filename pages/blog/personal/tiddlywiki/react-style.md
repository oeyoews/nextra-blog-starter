In React, styles=`{{}}` is a way to define inline styles for a component using JavaScript objects.

The styles prop is an object that contains key-value pairs of CSS property names and their corresponding values. Each key represents a CSS property name, and each value is the value to be applied to that property. For example:

```jsx
<div style={{ 
	color: 'red', 
	fontSize: '16px'
}}>
	Hello, World!
</div>
```

In the above example, we define an inline style for a `<div>` element. The styles prop is set to an object with two properties: color and fontSize. The color property is set to 'red', and the fontSize property is set to 16px.

Note that the styles prop is actually a JavaScript object, not a string. The double curly braces `{{}}` are used to indicate that we are passing a JavaScript object as a prop. The inner set of curly braces contains the JavaScript object itself.

Using inline styles with the styles prop in React can be useful for adding dynamic styling to a component, since the values can be computed dynamically using JavaScript expressions.
